In this modern era, with high-speed internet access to data has become more convenient and much easier.
This has got both its boons and banes. On the one hand, this presents a chance to expand our knowledge,
but on the other, it hinders the creative process. Especially concerning students in educational institutions,
their work needs to be distinctive and unique. This upholds and nurtures a culture of intellectual integrity
and honesty by providing a positive environment for all end users, making plagiarism a serious matter of
concern.

To ensure that students are recognized for their sincere efforts, it is advised to maintain a system that keeps
track of the plagiarism history of every student in a university. Our business evaluates the amount of
plagiarism a person has done over a period of time and the corresponding consequences will be carried out
depending on the percentage of plagiarism the student has committed.

WORKING THEORY

For each project the student submits, the professor checks the authenticity of that project with plagiarismchecking
software. This software in turn gives a report that mentions the percentage of plagiarism
committed in that project, by referring to various external sources. This process will be tracked for all the
submitted projects and a cumulative review will be done on every submission and gets flagged if the average
plagiarism percentage crosses the threshold limit.
 If the average plagiarism is less than 5%, then it's considered fair use.
 For anything between 5% to 10%, a warning would be sent to the student and the student has to
work on reducing the average plagiarism percentage in the upcoming project works.
 For anything between 11% and 20%, a serious warning must be made and it will be reported to the
university and the project sponsor. If it occurs again, the project will be disqualified from the
curriculum.
 If the plagiarism percentage exceeds 20%, the student will be expelled from the university and will
have to face legal consequences.

For the sake of our business case, both the student and the professor will be affiliated with the same
institution, but they may be from different colleges. The university will record the name, mobile number,
email, and address of each person. For students, it is also required to record the Student ID, Department,
Major, and coursework. Similarly for each professor, it is required to record the Professor ID, Department,
and subjects handled. Every student must do a project under the guidance of the professor. Each project
must have a project ID, Name, supervisor, budget, and start and end date. These projects may be funded by
industry or a company. At the start of the project, the company should provide the quotation including the
name, funding amount, and duration.

Once the student submits the Project, the professor checks that report in Plagiarism checking software.
Every software has license details, validity, and expiration date. The software then checks with multiple
external sources such as websites, journals, publications, etc. Then a report is generated consisting of the
report ID, date of submission, plagiarism percentage, sources, and versions. Finally, the extracted report is
matched with the students to build an average plagiarism score and intimate to the professor for further
action.

OTHER RELATIONSHIPS

1. Each student is under the guidance of a single professor for their project, whereas the professor can
manage zero to many students.
2. A student may do one to several projects, but the project must be completed by at least one student.
Similarly, the project may involve one or more students, however, each student should only present
in one project at a time.
3. A project can be funded by a company whereas the company may or may not fund projects.
4. There must be one similarity report for each project, and it must be executed using exactly one
project as input.
5. The professor must view one to many reports, but the reports must be reviewed by exactly one
professor.
6. Each report must be generated using only one plagiarism software and the software can generate
many reports.
7. Plagiarism software must have many external sources and the sources can be utilized by multiple
software too.
8. The report needs to be verified by at least one outside source, and that same source can also verify
many subsequent reports.
